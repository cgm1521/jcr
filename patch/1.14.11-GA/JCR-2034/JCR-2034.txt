Problem description

What is the problem to fix?

Fix description

Problem analysis
	* In case the JCR content is corrupted for an unknown reason or the node is concurrently removed while indexing we can face unexpected situations which can cause NPE.

How is the problem fixed?
	* We modified the code to make it more flexible in order to prevent any NPE and added some debug messages to be able to track this kind of unexpected situations if needed

Tests to perform
